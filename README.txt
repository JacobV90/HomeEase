Issues In This Release:
No specific issues that should yield errors in the
running of this program.


Views That Are Incomplete: We are still working to come up with a suitable way
to have a user enter credit card payment information as well as as entering monetary
amounts to send to specific users. Because our project is somewhat large scale, things
like this will take more time to develop than our more basic menus, which have already
been implemented.

Supported Devices: All modern iOS and Android devices are suitable for
running our application.
